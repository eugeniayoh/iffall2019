					<li> My name is Eugenia Yoh and I am a junior in communication design</li>

					<li> I am from Orange County, California and in my free time I like to watercolor and read children's books. I am taking this class because it would be good to know to code, especially in the graphic design industry.</li>

					<li> I have absolutely no background with any coding program. </li>

					<li> I hope to be able to learn how to code my own website by the end of this course or have a better understanding of how coding works in general</li>

					<li> Designing for screen is more interactive, whereas designing for paper tends to be static and one dimensional. This being said, designing for screen forces you to think past the canvas and through various subsections.</li>

					<li> https://www.colorfactory.co In my opinion, this website is visually engaging and easy to browse. Not only is it intuitive to navigate, but it also embodies the museum's mission: a fun, colorful, creative space. </li> 

					<li> https://mollymagnell.com/aquariumrebrand/ I love this website because it lets you browse through this artist's portfolio website in a very linear way, as if she was giving you a tour of her work.</li>

					<li> https://vannavu.com/zazz/ I believe for the sake of displaying a personal type, this site is very successful. This is one of the senior capstones from last year. It doesn't take a long time to navigate (though it takes some exploring to find the nontraditionally displayed menu bar), but moreover, it is interesting to look at. There are options that engage the audience's attention by forcing them to interact and personalize something that has been already constructed.  </li>
