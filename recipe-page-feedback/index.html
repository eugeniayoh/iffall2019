<em><div style= "font-size: 15pt; font-weight:bold"> Things to consider </div></em>
<div style= "font-family: 'Abel', sans-serif;">
-Add some margin and padding so it doesn't reach edge to edge on moblie view. While it looks fine on desktop, when you open it up, the words get a little lost. 
<br>
-Has closing quotation but does not have an openning quotation in the description. Fix that!!! 
<br>
-Assumed that the underline and hovering make it feel like it should be a link when it is not. Perhaps get rid of the red underline for each category or consider omitting the hovering rounded rectangle because it looks like a button.
<br>
-Do something with hovering and images? Cut down on the negative space with the circular images or make the circles bigger. 
<br>
-Add some space between the border box and the dots/ steps. Feels too clunky. 
The circles are too close to the information.

<div style= "font-family: 'Abel', sans-serif;">
<br>
My next steps would be to fix everything mentioned above. I might consider getting rid of the hovering function for the titles specifically. For the invidvidual steps and ingredients hovering function, it actually works in mobile because you can actually click on it and it will shift color. This can help readers locate where they are on the page.
