<em><div style= "font-size: 15pt; font-weight:bold "> Stylistic choices to consider</div></em>
<br>
Top bar could have author's name rather than the recipe name <br>
Be consistent with number circles (centered or aligned at top?) <br>
Be aware of spaces (negative space at the bottom? How could dit be filled?) Have something in the space so the content isn't exactly at the bottom.
<br> 
Can keep ingredient number in the circle because it helps differentiate the number.  <br>
